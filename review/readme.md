  Google Earth Engine (GEE) was compared to ArcGIS, QGIS
  - GEE
    - Steep learning curve
    - Seemless integration with other Google products (Google- Maps, Earth)
    - Easy code sharing
  - ArcGIS/QGIS:
    - Easy to use GUI
    - Data is stored and processed locally on users' computerss

         - caution, advice
         - sympathy, support
         - evidence of injury, mortality, missing people, damage infrastructure, etc.

   - Problem: Different scales representing ditches drain rainwater need to be matched  
   - Background:
       - Common GNN types: 
           - graph sample and aggregate (SAG): neighbour sampling / aggregrate functions to extract neighborhood info  
           - topological adaptive graph convolutional (TAGC): skips connections to enhance stronger generlization performance  
   - Approach: supervised GNN 
       - 3 SAGEConv + 1 TAGConv layers
       - Node characterizations: 
           - topological: number of adjacent ditches, connectivity to lakes
           - semantic: hierarchy level; group by width levels 
           - geometric: length of ditch segment 
           - contextual: distribution density of ditch segments
       - Experimented on Netherlands' ditch data
